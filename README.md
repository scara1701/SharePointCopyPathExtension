One of the things I frequently perform is copying the path of a file in a SharePoint library, not creating a link via the â€˜Shareâ€™ menu.

There is a copy path icon in the details section of the file in SharePoint.

There is however one annoying caveat for this function. It is always beneath the â€˜Activity sectionâ€™, which on a file with a lot of activity is constantly loading. This makes the â€˜Copy pathâ€™ option always move down right before I manage to click on it.

I was in the process of learning to build webparts for SharePoint. So I ended up writing an extension that adds a â€˜copy pathâ€™ option to the menubar of the document library.

Afterwards you can paste the link from your clipboard! ðŸ™‚
